    [tests](./Phonebook/decription.md): written in quera text testing format<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>

    [problem descrption](./Phonebook/decription.md)

    [example solution](./PhoneBook/solution/Main.java)





<sup>[1](#myfootnote1) quera text testing format contains an `in` and an `out` folder, prompts `in/input1.txt` as `stdin` to the program. and expects the output written to `stdout` to be exactly like `out/output1.txt`. 
and `out/output2.txt` belongs to `in/input2.txt` and so on. you can implement a *c++* program named `tester.cpp` in order to override the comparison of the submissions output with the correct one. you can see an example of `tester.cpp` [here](./Phonebook/tests/tester.cpp)
